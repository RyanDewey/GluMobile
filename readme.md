# Ryan Dewey's GluMobile Project Submission V1

This is code for a priority queue web-api server, that can be used to add and update “jobs” on a queue.

Designed to be deployed using a MySQL database.

Postman API tests are located at: GluMobile/tests/API

To host the project locally on port 8000 run: php -S localhost:8000 -t GluMobile/public

There are many more things I'd love to improve if I had the time. There are TODOs throughout the code that specify a few areas that need improving. In addition to those: API tests need to be more thorough, more caching can be done for performance, many many more comments, and I did not have a chance to stress test it.
